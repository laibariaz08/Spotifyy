# Spotify App in Kotlin
## Project Overview
This project aims to develop a simple Spotify client app using Kotlin for Android. It will provide users with basic functionalities similar to the official Spotify app, allowing them to log in, browse music, and manage their profile.
## Setup Instructions
First of all I downloaded Android Studio with SDKs, Then i created a project **Empty View Activity** for my Spotify Application, then i created a Public Repository named as **Spotify** where i am going to push my whole project, After that the first thing i did is to connect my Android Studio Project which is also named as "Spotify" to my GitHub Repository(This Repository).
## Screens designed and their purpose
I designed 3 Screens for my First Delieverable, These Screens are: Login, Home Page, Profile Page
Home Page is where all the songs, Artists and Albums are shown (Right now it is static) which will be according to the user preferences and interests 
In Profile Page, User's Profile is gonna be maintained.
Login Page: Of course User will get into the app by logging in using his/her account. 
## Technical challenges faced and future plans
Challanges i Faced are firstly related to connecting my Project to my GitHub Repository, It took some time as i was very new to Android Studio, Then of course i was getting errors in the layout pages which i somehow resolved by giving alot of concentration and time.
Future Plans are of course to make other pages, then of course as the course proceeds i'll keep implementing the thing side by side.
